# Annatar

Rust-powered SaaS for mission‑critical modernization across U.S. **defense**, **utilities**, and **infrastructure**.

> We design and deliver reliable, security‑first software that upgrades legacy systems without drama. Fast where it matters, conservative where it counts.

---

## What we do

* **Modernize critical workflows**: planning, scheduling, incident response, and field operations.
* **Operational visibility**: real‑time telemetry, audit trails, and compliance‑friendly reporting.
* **Resilience by default**: high‑availability services, graceful degradation, and clear runbooks.
* **Secure data exchange**: least‑privilege APIs, verifiable pipelines, and deterministic processing.

## Why Rust

* **Memory safety** without a garbage collector for predictable latency.
* **Performance** suitable for edge devices and data‑heavy backends.
* **Reliability** backed by strong typing, tests, and fearless refactoring.

## Principles

1. **Safety first** — threat modeling, strong defaults, and minimal attack surface.
2. **Reliability** — SLAs, incident response, and post‑incident learning baked in.
3. **Auditability** — immutable logs, clear change control, and traceable deployments.
4. **Simplicity** — fewer moving parts, boring tech where possible, sharp tools where needed.
5. **Respect for operators** — good logs, clear alerts, and fast rollback paths.

## Areas we serve

* U.S. **defense** programs with exacting reliability and review needs
* Public and private **utilities** (power, water, gas) modernizing field and control workflows
* Critical **infrastructure** operators improving uptime and safety

> We ship SaaS, but we think like systems engineers. Uptime and clear failure modes trump cleverness.

## Product foundations

* **Backend**: Rust (Axum, Tokio), typed errors, structured logs (tracing)
* **Data**: PostgreSQL (SQLx), migrations gated in CI
* **Observability**: OpenTelemetry/Prometheus ready, correlation IDs everywhere
* **Security**: strong auth, least privilege, encrypted at rest/in transit
* **Delivery**: containers, repeatable deploys, and environment‑based configuration

## A note on the name

In an older tale, a certain figure once styled himself a *giver of gifts*. We prefer gifts that pass audits, survive load tests, and reduce pager noise. Rings not included.

## Working with Annatar

* Engagements start with a short discovery: goals, constraints, and risk review.
* We deliver in small, verifiable increments with tests and clear acceptance.
* You get honest timelines, documented trade‑offs, and operational runbooks.
